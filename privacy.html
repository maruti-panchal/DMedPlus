            GDPR requires that the information we hold about you is accurate and current. We rely on our patients to tell us if they have moved house, or had medical treatment abroad. For our part, we will update your medical records at each consultation with a doctor or a nurse (either face to face, or by telephone), and with any relevant information we receive from hospital, community or social services providers (e.g. new diagnoses, change in circumstances).

        <p><strong>Data Controller</strong></p>
        <p>
            The Data Protection Act 2018 requires organisations to register a notification with the Information Commissioner to describe the purposes for which they process personal and sensitive information.
We are registered as the data controller and our registration can be viewed online in the public register .
Any changes to this notice will be published on our website and in a prominent area at the Practice.

        </p>
        <p><strong>The basis on which we process information about you</strong></p>
        <p>
            The Law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category. If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data. If the basis changes then, if required by Law, we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Lawful basis for processing</strong></p>

            The legal basis will be
Article 6(1)(c) “processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.”
And
Article 9(2)(h) “processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards ”

If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.
We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Why do we collect this information?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Information we process with your consent</strong></p>
            <p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, including job opportunities and our services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.
                Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.

                    Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:
                    •	whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
                    •	whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
                    •	whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would consider it reasonable to do so
                    For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:
                    •	record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business or profession
                    •	responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response

                    •	insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business or professional risk
                    •	protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so
                    
                </p>

This may include your personal information.

                </p>
                <p><strong>Who else may ask to access your information</strong></p>

                    •	Solicitors often ask for medical reports. These will always be accompanied by your signed consent for us to disclose information. We will not normally release details about other people that are contained in your records (e.g. wife, children parents etc.) unless we also have their consent
                    •	Social Services – The Benefits Agency and others may require medical reports on you from time to time.
