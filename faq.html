        <div class="question">Is it a reliable, genuine and good NGO?</div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            Many NGOs are legitimate, working diligently, and using donated
            funds honestly. However, there are exceptions and it is often not
            possible to tell whether an NGO is reliable or not from its online
            presence. Furthermore, it is not time or cost effective for a donor
            to physically determine if the charity they are donating to is a
            good one. GiveIndia is committed to resolving this problem. To
            bridge the trust gap between donors and nonprofits, all NGOs listed
            on our platform undergo a thorough due diligence process before
            being profiled. They are routinely reviewed too. Information about
            their operations and outcomes is easily accessible, and donors are
            encouraged to view it. You can read more about GiveAssured,
            GiveIndia’s promise to honour your trust here, and can look at some
            frequently asked questions about how NGOs are vetted here. Start

        <div class="question">How urgent are the charity’s needs?</div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            Although all charities do important, essential work in their
            respective sectors, every NGO is not equally well known. Large and
            established organizations tend to have greater access to donors and
            are consequently better funded. Hence, when you donate to NGOs in
            India, it can be useful to ask: does this organization require funds
            right now? If so, how urgent are their needs? GiveIndia provides
            answers to these questions. Charities are clearly labeled with tags
            like “Under Funded” or “Extreme Need” to identify especially needy
            charities and beneficiaries. Such labels are explained in careful
            detail too. Underfunded programmes are those that are doing great
            work, but are struggling to continue to help people as they are not
            receiving the monetary support they need. Those in extreme need are
            usually socially excluded and lack necessities for reasons such as
            living in underserved areas or social stigma. Thus, even once you
            have identified a genuine and good NGO to donate to, it can be
            helpful to ask if your donation will have the greatest impact.
            Through GiveIndia, you can easily donate to a charity that urgently
            requires your help!<br /><br />

        <div class="question">Who is your donation benefiting?</div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            When you donate to a charity, it is important to understand who
            benefits from your donation. Although it is easy to assume that the
            beneficiaries of your donation are the people you hope to help, this
            may not always be the case. For example, if the NGO is large and
            runs multiple projects, it may be important to ensure you are
            donating to the particular project you want to support. If you are
            donating through a third-party platform, it may be necessary to ask
            how much of your donation is retained by them. GiveIndia recognises
            that donors want to create the greatest positive impact when they
            donate to NGOs in India. Hence, information about projects,
            beneficiaries, and how the donation is distributed is easily
            available. Every listed campaign provides specific details about the
            programme and its beneficiaries. GiveIndia ensures that 90% of your
            contribution reaches your chosen NGO by keeping fundraising costs at
            a maximum of 10%. Donations are sent to the nonprofit organizations
            once a month with a transaction-wise report. This helps them
            understand the purpose of each donation, and allows them to plan
            their spending accordingly. This forms the basis of the nonprofit’s
            report with updates on the programme, which is then shared with the
            donor. You can learn more about GiveIndia and the donation process
            here.<br /><br />

        <div class="question">Are the charity’s payment methods safe?</div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            Online giving is incredibly convenient. It negates the distance
            between donors, and charities, allowing the former to support causes
            they are passionate about regardless of where they may be situated.
            However, making an online donation is accompanied by payment
            security challenges. Unsafe payment methods have the potential to
            cause losses to donors and can deprive charities and beneficiaries
            of much-needed funds. GiveIndia takes these concerns very seriously,
            maintaining transparency and accountability about the measures in
            place to ensure the safety of donors’ data. GiveIndia protects the
            information donors provide when they donate to NGOs in India by
            enforcing very high standards on credit card security. GiveIndia
            does not store any payment information on its servers either.
            Through GiveIndia, online giving is convenient and safe. Now you can
            safely donate to NGOs in India!

        <div class="question">
          Are there any tax benefits of your donation to NGOs?
        </div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            Making charitable donations is inherently selfless, but it can
            benefit donors as well. Giving has been proven to make donors
            happier, and can also provide monetary benefits to them through tax
            exemptions. If you are an Indian taxpayer, donations to Givelndia
            are eligible for 50% tax exemption under Section 80(G). If you are a
            taxpayer in the US, you can avail of the tax exemption for donations
            made through 501(c)(3). As a taxpayer in the UK, your donation is
            eligible for Gift Aid. Let’s save you some tax while doing good for
            someone in need! Support a girl’s education by donating just $8.15

          I would like to donate an item (e.g. furniture, clothing, etc.). How
          can I do that?
        </div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            It is important to make sure the items you are donating align with
            the actually needs. The best way to donate an item is to connect
            with us directly and find out what type of donations would be most
            helpful. Most of schools, hospitals and other organisations which
            need support typically have a “wish list”. If you visit our “Active
            Campaigns” section you will come to know of their needs and things
            required.

          The problem is huge! Will my small contribution make a difference?
        </div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            Like it is said, a small amount goes a long way. Small donations
            make almost 90 to 95% of our entire donation collected. These small
            contributions that collectively add up to a large amount are needed
            to effect change. There are people all over the world who are
            worried about the situation of poor people, schools and who want to
            do something to change it. However, due to their own commitments and
            they are not able to go out and directly work with NGOs’. We give
            them the opportunity to help in whatever way they can. They can
            contribute their money, materials, time, or skills. Every
            individual’s contribution is important.

        <div class="question">How are resources used?</div>
        <div class="answercont">
          <div class="answer">
            We have learned that effecting long-term, sustainable change
            requires a holistic approach. Accomplishing this kind of change
            necessitates work at three levels: • Direct action in the form of
            education, health care and skill development. • Community
            mobilization towards achievement of goals. • Advocacy with
            government bodies to influence policy framing and implementation.
            Financial support and non-financial inputs in the form of
            organization development, capacity building and training is extended
            to: • Individuals and projects working directly with local
            communities and government bodies • Resource organisations that
            provide training, education material, etc. to smaller, younger
            initiatives in particular
